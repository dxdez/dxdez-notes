[Unofficial Dotfiles Guide](https://dotfiles.github.io/inspiration/ "Unofficial Dotfiles Guide") - A list of existing dotfiles for inspiration. You can learn a lot by looking at how other people set up their dotfiles. Because dotfiles can be highly personalized, not all of these are necessarily meant to be used “as-is” by others; still, they serve as a useful reference. 

[Neovim LUA](https://github.com/brainfucksec/neovim-lua/tree/main "Neovim LUA") - A repository for solid configuration of Lua on a Neovim setup. 

[ULauncher Configuration](https://docs.ulauncher.io/en/stable/ "ULauncher Configuration") - The documentation for ULauncher and how to extend and alter the themes of the application.
