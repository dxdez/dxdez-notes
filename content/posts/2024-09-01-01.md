The following list outlines key steps to enhance proficiency as a software engineer. These steps are provided in an unordered manner, and there is no specific order in which they need to be undertaken. Original list was created by user npmaile on Github.

**Install [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) on the main computer and utilize it for all computing tasks.**
Arch Linux encourages a deeper understanding of computing environments, command-line usage, and modular computing. The experience gained includes using the command line, scripting, and referencing the valuable [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org) for software debugging.

**Read [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).**
Delve into this free Python book to acquire insights into automating general tasks using the Python programming language. These simple yet powerful programs serve as a foundation for understanding programming basics and the capability of writing programs to solve real-world problems.

**Master a text editor.**
Choose between [Neovim](https://neovim.org), [Emacs](https://emacs.org), or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Proficiency in a text editor is crucial, given that a significant portion of a software developer's work involves editing text files. Personalize your choice as the editor's effectiveness directly impacts productivity.

**Create a profile on [Github](https://github.com/) and grasp the basics of version control with git.**
Utilize Github to showcase productivity by housing all code and relevant materials. Git, a complex yet essential tool, becomes more understandable with regular use. Recommended reading includes the initial chapters of [this book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for comprehensive guidance.

**Learn [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).**
Embrace Markdown for documentation, note-taking, and general writing tasks. Its widespread use in software circles, coupled with the ability to convert formats using tools like [pandoc](https://pandoc.org), makes it an invaluable skill for writing program documentation and various written materials.

**Start lurking on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs).**
Engage in discussions on tech topics, observe trends, and familiarize yourself with in-group terminology. These platforms expose you to diverse opinions and a plethora of blog posts, contributing to your understanding of programming and technology concepts.

**Write a website from scratch and host it on a server.**
Develop a website independently, gaining insights into website construction and server deployment. Consider platforms like [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) or [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/). This hands-on experience introduces valuable concepts for making software accessible to others.

**Read [The Go Book](https://www.gopl.io/).**
Familiarize yourself with the Go programming language, widely used in corporate business programming. This language is recognized for its versatility and relevance in the job market. Consider exploring [Node](https://nodejs.org) as a second language, especially if web development appeals to you.

**Research functional programming and write a program.**
Explore functional programming paradigms, such as [Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/) and [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/). Regardless of the program's purpose, gaining exposure to functional programming offers a unique perspective and enhances overall programming skills.

**Complete problems on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).**
Solve approximately 20 problems on Leetcode to grasp common ways of writing performant code and understand fundamental algorithms. Avoid excessive focus on these problems, aiming for a balance between interview preparation and practical programming knowledge.
