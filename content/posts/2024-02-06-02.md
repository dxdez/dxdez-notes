When adjusting the “Switch to workspace X” in the Settings for keyboard shortcuts, the maximum number of configurable workspaces ends at four spaces.

It turns out that when this Settings menu got created, the authors assumed that most people don’t use more than four workspaces so they only put setting options for the first four in this menu. I understand that they didn’t want to have too many “Switch to workspace X” items in this menu, but my use case happens to be different. Luckily, the keyboard bindings can be easily set in the CLI. This will show you what the current bindings are:

````
gsettings list-recursively org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings | grep switch-to-workspace
````

and this command will associate the “switch to workspace 5” to the combination of Super key and numeric keypad 5

````
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-5 "[\"<Super>5\"]"
````

This is to be repeated for the rest of the workspaces. Note, this configuration was done on Fedora 39, running Gnome DE.
