If you are hosting your HUGO project on a development server or virtual machine, you may want to expose the IP address in order to preview the site on another machine. Typically when running the `hugo serve / hugo server` command it will only bind it to the localhost and not to any external address that you can use. 

A simple workaround is to use the `bind` and `baseURL` command to assign an address. You can find the specific address on your machine using the `hostname -I` command in Linux. From there you can run the following in your project directory.
`````
hugo server --buildDrafts --bind {ip-address} --baseURL http://{ip-address}
`````

Note: the enviornment that you are running your HUGO project on may have firewall settings enabled. In order to allow the firewall to continue running without blocking your site, you can create an exception to allow the port that HUGO runs on. Refer to the script below; it is reccomended to save this as a `.sh` file and then execute using `sudo bash ./{filename}.sh`
`````
YOURPORT=1313
PERM="--permanent"
SERV="$PERM --service=hugo"

firewall-cmd $PERM --new-service=hugo
firewall-cmd $SERV --set-short="Hugo ports"
firewall-cmd $SERV --set-description="Hugo port exceptions"
firewall-cmd $SERV --add-port=$YOURPORT/tcp
firewall-cmd $PERM --add-service=hugo
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
`````
