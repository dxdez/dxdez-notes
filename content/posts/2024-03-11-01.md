If you are hosting your django project on a development server or virtual machine, you may want to expose the IP address in order to preview the site on another machine. Typically when running the `runserver` command it will only bind it to the localhost and not to any external address that you can use. \

A simple workaround is to append the ipaddress to the runserver command, along with the PORT#, to get your desired endpoint. 
`````
python manage.py runserver <your-ip-address>:<desired-port>
`````
You can find the exact address of your server / vm by running the following command in Linux. 
`````
hostname -I
`````
From there, we can add a port number to expose this address. For this example, we will use the combination: 192.168.124.140:1313 \

Note that your project on may have firewall settings enabled. \

In order to allow the firewall to continue running without blocking your site, you can create an exception to allow the port that your project runs on. Refer to the script below; it is reccomended to save this as a `.sh` file and then execute using `sudo bash ./{filename}.sh`
`````
YOURPORT=1313
PERM="--permanent"
SERV="$PERM --service=hugo"

firewall-cmd $PERM --new-service=hugo
firewall-cmd $SERV --set-short="Hugo ports"
firewall-cmd $SERV --set-description="Hugo port exceptions"
firewall-cmd $SERV --add-port=$YOURPORT/tcp
firewall-cmd $PERM --add-service=hugo
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
`````
Once these settings have been configured, we can run the following command in our django project. 
`````
python manage.py runserver 192.168.124.140:1313
`````
