The proper way to push a new project into an existing GitHub repository follows these steps:

* Create a GitHub repository for the existing project.
* Copy the GitHub URL for the new repo to the clipboard.
* Perform a git init command in the root folder of the existing project.
* Add all of the existing project’s files to the Git index and then commit.
* Add the GitHub repo as a remote reference for the existing project.
* Perform a git push operation with the -u and -f switches.
* Verify that the existing project’s files have been pushed to GitHub.

Here are the Git commands used in this tutorial. These commands assume a push to a GitHub repo named existing-website:
`````
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add existing project files to Git"
git remote add origin https://github.com/cameronmcnz/example-website.git
git push -u -f origin master
`````
