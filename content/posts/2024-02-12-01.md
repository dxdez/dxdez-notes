## Requirements

Before beginning the deployment, we need to check that our server meets all the requirements necessary to run Laravel, referencing the [Laravel Server Requirement](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/deployment#server-requirements "Laravel Server Requirement") docs. You can confirm your PHP version meets the minimum version requirement by creating and running a page on your server that invokes the phpinfo() function.
 
### Additional Requirements:
* A Laravel application that exists in a repository on Github.com
* A web server running Nginx with SSH access
* A domain or subdomain configured to point to that server
* Your web server needs to have SSH keys set up with Github
