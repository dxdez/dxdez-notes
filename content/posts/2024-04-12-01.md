## LGTM

* [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki), like Prometheus, but for logs.
* [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), the open and composable observability and data visualization platform.
* [Tempo](https://github.com/grafana/tempo), a high volume, minimal dependency distributed tracing backend.
* [Mimir](https://github.com/grafana/mimir), the most scalable [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) backend.

## Building scalable OSS observability

Demonstration video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ3B2aSmA9o "here") - this video is about the scalability and performance of the open source telemetry backends that make up the Grafana LGTM Stack: Grafana Mimir for Prometheus metrics, Grafana Loki for logs, and Grafana Tempo for traces.
