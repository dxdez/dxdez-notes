To clone your VM and spawn new instances in KVML
`````
# virt-clone --original {Domain-Vm-Name-Here} --auto-clone
`````
OR
`````
# virt-clone --original {Domain-Vm-Name-Here} --name {New-Domain-Vm-Name-Here} --auto-clone
`````
OR
`````
# virt-clone --original {Domain-Vm-Name-Here} \
--name {New-Domain-Vm-Name-Here} --file {/var/lib/libvirt/images/File.Name.here}
`````
  

### Cloning Guests with virt-clone

First VM/domain with devices to clone must be paused or shutoff. To gracefully shutdown a domain named ubuntu-box1, run:
`````
$ sudo virsh shutdown ubuntu-box1
`````
OR you can paused it as follows:
`````
$ sudo virsh suspend ubuntu-box1
$ virsh list
`````

Sample outputs:
`````
Domain ubuntu-box1 suspended

 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------
 1     freebsd                        running
 5     ubuntu-box1                    paused

`````

Let us generate a new guest name, and paths for new storage automatically for a vm called ubuntu-box1
`````
$ sudo virt-clone --original ubuntu-box1 --auto-clone
`````

Sample outputs:
`````
WARNING  Setting the graphics device port to autoport, in order to avoid conflicting.
Allocating 'ubuntu-box-1-clone.qcow2'                                                              |  40 GB  00:00:04     

Clone 'ubuntu-box1-clone' created successfully.
`````

The above command cloned the guest called “demo” on the default connection, auto generating a new name called ubuntu-box1-clone and disk clone path. You can start or resume original domain:
`````
$ sudo virsh start ubuntu-box1
`````
OR
`````
$ sudo virsh resume ubuntu-box1
`````

Next, start ubuntu-box1-clone, enter:
`````
$ sudo virsh start ubuntu-box1-clone
`````

Verify it:
`````
$ virsh list
`````
